[Reactronic](https://github.com/Nezaboodka/reactronic#readme)
is a JavaScript library that provides
[transactionally reactive](https://blog.nezaboodka.com/post/2019/593-modern-database-should-natively-support-transactionally-reactive-programming)
state management in a Web application.
Transactional reactivity means that state changes are being made
in an isolated data snapshot and then, once atomically committed,
are **consistently propagated** to corresponding visual components
for (re)rendering. All that is done in automatic, seamless, and
fine-grained way.
